    "Ans : In flask ,app routing refers to the process of mapping urls (uniform resource locators) to specific functions or views in flask application.\n",
    "It allows you to define different routes or urls that users can access and associate them with corresponding functions that handle the requests and return responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "example of defining route in flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",

    " In this code we defined two routes using the '@app.route()'decorator.\n",
    " '/' : It corresponds to homepage.\n",
    " '/about' : corresponds to the about page\n",
    " When a user visits these urls in web browser, Flask will invoke the respective function and return the associated response.\n",
    "   \n",
    "App routing is essential in Flask application for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.URL Mapping: By defining routes, you can specify the different URLs or paths users can access in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows logical structrure and organization of web application content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Request Handling: Routes enable you to handle different types of HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST) for specific URLs. Each route can have a corresponding function that processes the request and generates a response, such as rendering a template or returning JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Dynamic Routing: Flask allows you to create dynamic routes by including variable parts in the URL. For example, you can define a route like '/user/<username>', where <username> represents a dynamic value. \n",
    "    \n",
    "This enables you to create flexible routes that can handle a variety of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Separation of Concerns: App routing helps in separating different functionalities or views of your application. Each route can be associated with a specific function that handles that particular part of the application.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This promotes modular and maintainable code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.RESTful APIs: For building RESTful APIs, app routing becomes even more critical. Each route can be associated with specific API endpoints, allowing clients to interact with different resources or perform specific actions."
